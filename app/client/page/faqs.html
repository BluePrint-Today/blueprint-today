                  <h2>How do I enter grades?</h2>
                  <p>
                    In the table cell before the days course description you can enter either a percentage like 90 
                    or you can enter a fraction of correct over total like 48/50 and the percentage will be calculated.

                  <h2>What if something doesn't need a grade?</h2>
                  <p>
                    If you have a task like "Read chapter 1" but there is no homework or quiz for that, just leave the grade
                    blank.  A blank grade doesn't mean 0 it means no grade and is not used to calculate the final course total grade.

                  <h2>Can I have weighted grades?</h2>
                    <p>
                      When you enter a description for a day there is a dropdown above the field.  You can choose from default (suitable for homework or general work),
                      quizes, and tests.  If you only use default for everything then everything will have the same weight and all grades will be averaged together.
                      If you use default and another like test then all default grades will be averaged together and account for 50% of the final grade, all
                      test grades will be averaged together and account for the other half of the final grade.  If you use all three grade types then each type
                      will account for 1/3 of the final grade.

                <h2>Can I assign different weight values to each grade type?</h2>
                <p>
                  To keep things simplified and quick to use each grade type is fixed to have equal weight.
