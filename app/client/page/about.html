            BluePrint Today started six years ago as a simple spreadsheet for my wife. She was tracking everything by hand on paper
            and calculating final grades became a tedious process.  Using a computer was the obvious solution, but all of the programs we found
            were painful to use.  Most were based on public school solutions which don't work well for homeschooling.  In a public school
            model a teacher has a few classes and a large number of students, but homeschools are the complete opposite.  A homeschool
            parent is teaching many courses to a few students.  We needed a solution that was designed just for homeschools so I created
            a spreadsheet for my wife with a simple week-at-a-time view and only required the information needed for homeschooling.

            My wife used the spreadsheet for a couple of years; but it wasn't a perfect solution.  Every new school term I had to fix the
            spreadsheet to match the school term dates.  I decided to create a real program for her that automatically took care of
            everything related to tracking and scheduling assignments and grades.

            The program worked well and my wife has been using it for the past four years.  Last year my wife helped some of her friends
            get set up to use the program and they were excited to have such an easy-to-use solution to keep track of their assignments and grades.
            I realized the program needed to be opened up for public use.  There were some changes that need to be made before I could
            make it available for everyone; so I spent a year rewriting it from scratch to create the perfect homeschool solution.
            The code is open sourced and on GitHub so other programmers can help conribute to the project.

            I believe that making BluePrint Today available to everyone will help reduce the stress and workload of homeschool parents
            by combining the simplified structure of paper tracking with the digital efficiency of a software application.  
            Parents can now spend less time scheduling courses and tracking grades allowing them more time with their kids.
